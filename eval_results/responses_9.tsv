I thought the question about "I would like to use this type of a system" meant in theory about EMRs, not specific to epic/cerner. I had to go back and change that.  The proposed setup is great. I actually did create (manually, ugh) very similar daily bar charts of drug dosing and events along with physiological markers for one of my pediatric ICU patients when I was at the valley because of just how complex a case he was and how many moving parts were involved. I would present that chart in morning rounds every day and it was how I could keep things straight. I had to pull all the content from epic every day piece by piece, but I used the the physiological chart (temp/bp/map/hr) as my scaffold. It was a total train wreck, and I kept screaming inside that this should all just be automated and available at my fingertips on the fly. The fact that physicians don't demand this kind of thing just shows you how lost the medical field is.  Anyhow, very sweet mockup Baris, it gets the idea across well. I'd definitely clamor for something like this to get pushed out and tied to (or to replace) EPIC. So many frustrated hours wasted just fighting that stupid system.   Thanks,  Paul

On the medications graphical interface, all you can see is whether a patient is on a medication or not. But there is a huge difference between being on lisinopril 5mg daily and 40mg daily or prednisone 100mg vs 5mg daily, to name a few examples. So either way, you're forcing your user to make that extra few clicks. The same can be said on the clinical documentation page: lab results don't show up, just the fact that labs were drawn. So there's no way to see trends. The volume of notes written or imaging tests done on a given day is the only information your graphical interface gives, and that information isn't clinically useful: the contents of those notes are.   2) At the end of the day, the clinical interface is unimportant in an EMR. You can consider a beautiful or clinically useful interface essentially a favor to the clinician. At the end of the day, clinicians do not make a decision about whether or not to procure an EMR. The hospital administrators do. That's why Epic is so successful: their backend is marvelous (lol), which is useful to the administrators and CEOs of a hospital since it makes billing and quality improvement easier to do. What I'm basically saying is that while it's good that you're consulting students about what the EMR looks like, in a business plan for a new EMR, it should be the last thing you consider. Unless your new EMR has a backend or other database functionality that is distinctly better than existing EMRs, you will have a hard time getting hospitals/ACOs/even clinics to change from their current model.   Anyway, not to be too down on you. I think, overall, what you guys have built is beautiful and could be easier to digest for some clinicians than Epic is. Also, Epic is evil, so power to anyone trying to create a reasonable alternative. As you can probably tell, I think about this kind of  stuff a lot so I'd be happy to elaborate on anything if you'd like: nuriel@stanford.edu

These 'visualizations' could easily be pages epic might consider integrating into their system, but I see little foundation for a new type of EHR in this demo.

For example - having to mouse over for medication dosing is cumbersome, even for a snapshot I'd like to see how meds are changing doses over time (I don't think you had any changing dosages in your medications, or if they changed it wasn't represented by bar thickness).  It's also hard to know if the thickness of the bar is relative to other patients? this patients past history? recommended guidelines?  For the notes - a lot of notes (esp ED notes) are just quick updates and it takes a lot to weed through the fluff.  It might be helpful to also have labels for H&Ps and discharge summaries. Of note, if one can "deselect all" rather than having to unselect individually to get to one filter, that would be great.  I would use this for a broad overview to see what the status quo is, but if my patient wasn't doing well, I would want a more detail-oriented system that gives more immediate numbers on the go and a larger note-text preview with accompanying labs.    thanks for putting this together though - great interface and I look forward to seeing where it goes.
