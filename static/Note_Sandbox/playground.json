He was also noted to have an elevated BNP, and a clinical exam consistent with volume overload. This was felt to be secondary to dietary indiscretion. In addition to his COPD treatment, he received diuretics which resulted in a removal of 3L of fluid. He was told to lower his salt intake and try to refrain from eating McDonalds. <br>On speaking with the patient, he notes that he has been trying hard to lower his carbohydrate intake because his blood sugar was noted to be high during his hospitalization. He states that adiabetes education nurse instructed him to monitor his carbohydrate intake. He confesses that he still goes to McDonalds but has been removing the buns from his McRib sandwiches and is now eating 2-3 at each sitting. Furthermore he has also been frequenting KFC and enjoying their double down sandwich since it substitutes chicken for bread and has no bun. <br>This patient’s main complaint today is increased lower extremity swelling. He feels that his feet are heavy and it makes it hard to walk. He is requesting a handicap parking pass based on this and has brought in DMV paperwork for me to fill out. From a respiratory status, he does not report any significant complaints this afternoon. Of note, the patient states that he has been taking his medications without problems but he did note that he ran out of his “water pill” about 1 week ago. <br>Past Medical History:<br>1) Hypertension<br>2) GERD<br>3) Diabetes<br>4) Congestive Heart Failure<br>5) COPD<br>6) Osteoarthritis<br>Allergies:<br>NKDA<br>Current Medications:<br>glyburide 15mg daily<br>coreg 3.125mg bid<br>lasix 40mg daily<br>lisinopril 5 mg daily<br>advil prn<br>ROS:<br>Pertinent ROS are as per HPI.

The patient had presented to his PCP for URI symptoms 1 week prior to admission and likely had a viral condition at that time. This was possibly a trigger for his COPD exacerbation which ultimately led to decompensation and the patient’s eventual hospital admission. At presentation, the patient was noted to be hypoxic to 88% on RA and his ABG was notable for a respiratory acidosis: 7.25/67/80. During the hospital course, the patient was treated with Duoneb nebulizers, moxifloxacin, and IV steroids. At the time of discharge, the patient is currently sat’ing well in the mid 90’s on RA. He will continue moxifloxacin PO to complete a 1 week course. His steroids have also been transitioned to an oral regimen. He is currently on 40mg daily which he will continue for 3 more days, then 20mg x 3 days, 10mg x 3 days, 5mg x 3 days, then stop. Given the severity of his initial presentation, the patient will need to be followed closely as an outpatient. Our team has placed a referral to SUH Pulmonary Clinic to be seen in the next 2-4 weeks.<br>Congestive Heart Failure:<br>The patient’s presenting symptoms of shortness of breath were also likely partially due to fluid overload. The patient’s initial exam was notable for an elevated JVD, LE edema, and mild crackles on exam. These finding were supported by mild pulmonary edema seen on CXR and a moderately elevated BNP. We suspect that dietary indiscretion played a large role (Patient has been eating at McDonalds regularly). The patient’s fluid status was optimized following diuresis with lasix (net negative 3L). Patient was counseled regarding dietary choices, with particular attention to maintaining a low sodium diet. The patient’s cardiac workup including EKGs and cardiac enzymes was unremarkable. He has a prior TTE which showed an EF of 55%. We spoke with his outpatient cardiologist during this admission and have arranged for the patient to be seen in the next few days following discharge. <br>Diabetes:<br>The patient reports a long history of diabetes that does not appear to be optimally controlled. His most recent Hgb A1c was 9.2 just prior to admission. He was seen by our diabetes nurse educator during this admission and provided nutritional information and lifestyle recommendations. He was on 10mg glyburide prior to admission but on this regimen, his FS ranged as high as 220 and continued to require sliding scale insulin. This is likely due in part to the steroids that he is receiving for his COPD exacerbation. The patient will be discharged today on an increased dose of glyburide at 15mg daily. The requirement will likely decrease as his steroid dose is tapered. The patient has been instructed to monitor his FS at home. We have also scheduled a followup with his PCP in 10 days, and a Diabetes Clinic visit in 2 weeks<br>Condition of Patient at Discharge: improved<br>Disposition: to home<br>Discharge Medications<br>Current Discharge Medication List<br>CONTINUE these medications which have NOT CHANGED<br>Carvedilol 3.125mg tablet<br>take 3.125mg by mouth twice daily.<br>Furosemide 20mg tablet<br>take 40 mg by mouth daily.<br>Lisinopril 5 mg tablet<br>take 5 mg by mouth daily.<br>IBUPROFEN IB PO<br>take by mouth as needed<br>CONTINUE these medications which have CHANGED<br>Glyburide 5mg tablet<br>take 15 mg by mouth daily.<br>Discharge Orders/Instructions<br>Followup with Clinic Appointments as described below<br>Low salt, diabetic diet<br>Stanford Hospital and Clinics Appointments Scheduled in the Next 30 Days<br>Followup Appointment: Primary Care Physician<br>Followup Appointment: Cardiology Clinic<br>Followup Appointment: Pulmonary Clinic<br>Followup Appointment: Diabetes Clinic<br>Vaccinations history: <br>There is no immunization history on file for this patient. <br>Smoking: <br>Patient has been advised to quit if currently smoking or to remain tobacco-free if quit within the last 12 months. <br>"

No consolidations. <br>Assessment/Plan:<br>Patient is a 65 year old male with hx of COPD, CHF (EF 55%), DM and recent URI symptoms who presents with acute worsening of SOB. His presentation is likely multi-factorial. His exam and labs are consistent with a COPD exacerbation. His shortness of breath is also likely due in part to fluid overload in the setting of dietary indiscretion.<br>COPD: Patient’s ABG demonstrates a significant respiratory acidosis<br>-Solumedrol 125mg IV q6<br>-Moxifloxacin 400mg IV bid <br>-Cont supplemental O2 by nasal cannula, goal O2 ~92%. Avoid higher O2 to minimize V/Q mismatch<br>-Duonebs q4 RTC, q2 as needed<br>CHF: Most recent TTE showed EF 55% in 12/2010. Likely also contributing to patient’s symptoms given his elevated JVD and LE on exam as well as pleural effusions on CXR. The patient’s BNP is also elevated at 745. Fluid overload is likely due to recent dietary indiscretion.

Mr. Smith continues to have difficulty managing his multiple chronic medical conditions. He has a glucometer at home but does not check his fingersticks routinely. He has not been compliant with the diabetic diet that was recommended to him during his last visit. He continues to snack on junk food such as twinkies and twix candy bars regularly.<br>On a more positive note, Mr. Smith appears to be tolerating his current CHF regimen well. His exertional tolerance has not worsened. He reports being able to take 30 minute walks, or go up 2 flights up stairs before experiencing any difficulty. He denies PND, orthopnea, or SOB. In spite of not being very compliant with his dietary regimen, he has not appreciated any weight gain or leg swelling. He continues to enjoy fast food regularly, including several McDonald's McRib sandwiches per week. <br>Incidentally, he has not been sleeping well this week because of a 4 day history of dry non-productive cough. The patient is concerned because the cough has persisted this week. However, upon further questioning, he does report that the intensity and frequency does appear to be improving. He has tried over the counter Robitussin which seems to provide some relief. Of note, some of his close friends who he plays poker with several times a week, had similar symptoms last week but they are reportedly feeling better. He currently denies any fevers or chills, but does report some intermittent congestion. He does not report a sore throat, headaches, shortness of breath or dizziness.
