		     TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
		     
		     INDICATION:  Status post bypass surgery one week ago, now with chest pain at
		     incision site and drainage.  No fevers.  Also has gradual onset of shortness
		     of breath and fatigue.  Evaluate for effusions.
		     
		     FINDINGS:  Frontal view demonstrates status post anterior chest wall
		     reconstruction with four bars of hardware in horizontal position.  Position of
		     previously described chest tubes is unchanged including right jugular approach
		     central venous line.  No pneumothorax is identified in the apical regions. 
		     Since the last preceding study of 4-18, apparently a right-sided PICC line
		     has been added, seen to terminate overlying the SVC some 3 cm above the level
		     of the carina.  The mild blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus persists
		     and the lateral view discloses also some blunting of the posterior pleural
		     sinuses representing postoperative findings.
		     
		     Position of longitudinally directed multiple wire loops in the sternal area
		     appears unchanged and the row of subcutaneous clips is identified in the
		     anterior chest wall suture line, but no significant soft tissue changes can be
		     identified.

		     ______________________________________________________________________________
		                                     FINAL REPORT
		     INDICATION:  Recent CABG, sternal debridement and repair, now with new fluid
		     collection.
		     
		     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the chest
		     after uneventful administration of 90 mL of Optiray IV contrast.  Standard and
		     lung algorithm images as well as coronal reformats were obtained.  This study
		     was compared with 2014-4-9.
		     
		     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  Several mediastinal plates are seen; separation of
		     the sternal halves is still seen, particularly in the inferior aspect.
		     Additionally, a new large presternal fluid collection is present, greatest in
		     the space between the topmost and secondmost plates.  In the superior and the
		     inferior aspect of the sternotomy, it appears to communicate freely with the
		     retrosternal space (series 2, image 40), though the amount of retrosternal
		     fluid is markedly diminished since the 2014-4-9 study.  There is no
		     significant stranding or gas within the fluid collection. The fluid collection
		     is somewhat broad- based, measuring approximately 3.0 cm A-P, 13.0 cm
		     transverse.
		     
		     Small lymph nodes are noted in the mediastinum, the largest measuring 6 mm in
		     the precarinal region (2:21).  The pericardium is slightly thickened and
		     irregular, which is compatible with history of recent pericardial
		     intervention; the focus of pericardial calcification is unchanged.  The heart
		     is otherwise normal in size, with extensive coronary vascular calcifications.
		     
		     Lungs are notable for mild centrilobular emphysema.  Additionally,
		     interstitial reticular opacities, most pronounced in the lung periphery and at
		     the bases, are slightly worse than the last examination.  A 4-mm lung nodule
		     is seen in the right upper lobe (3:28).  Bilateral pleural effusions are again
		     seen; the right is slightly larger than the previous, the left slightly
		     smaller; both remains small.  There is associated compressive atelectasis.
		     
		     This study is not designed to examine the abdomen, however, multiple low-
		     density lesions in the liver are similar to the previous study; several of
		     these are too small to fully characterize; the largest is in the left lobe
		     measuring 23 mm, with fluid attenuation characteristics.  A left kidney lesion
		     measuring 10 mm represents a cyst.  The kidneys are incompletely imaged, but
		     fullness of the right collecting system is again seen.  No mass lesions are
		     identified in the imaged portion of the spleen or adrenals. There is a small
		     layering radiopaque gallstone.

		     BONE WINDOWS:  Aside from the sternal anatomy described above, no suspicious
		     sclerotic or lytic lesions are identified.  Large lipoma of the left
		     infraspinatus muscle is noted.
		     
		     IMPRESSION:
		     
		     1.  New large presternal fluid collection, with apparent communication with
		     the retrosternal space, but amount of retrosternal fluid is small and has
		     decreased since prior CT. Findings could represent postoperative seroma, but
		     infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. No
		     discrete abscess identified.
		     
		     2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, small, right greater than left.
		     
		     3.  Worsening mild peripheral and basilar reticular and ground glass
		     opacities. Given their short interval worsening, a drug reaction should be
		     considered. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis would be less likely to have
		     such a rapid progression.
		     
		     4.  Layering radiopaque gallstones.
		     
		     5.  A right kidney cyst and liver cyst, unchanged.  Other numerous liver
		     lesions are too small to characterize, but similar in appearance to previous
		     study.
		     
		     6.  Fullness of the right renal collecting system is incompletely imaged;
		     clinical correlation and/or imaging correlation recommended.
		     
		     7.  4-mm right lung nodule, for which followup is recommended in one year to
		     document stability.'

				moderate sized reversible perfusion abnormality involving the 
				anteroapical and septal portion left ventricle. There was also a 
				question of a small reversible abnormality involving the 
				inferolateral portion left ventricle.  The left ventricular wall 
				motion was normal.  The LVEF was 62%.
				.
				[**3195-3-27**] Cardiac Catheterization
				COMMENTS:      
				1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 
				severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main 
				coronary artery had no angiographically apparent flow limiting 
				stenoses.  The LAD was ectatic proximally and occluded in the 
				mid segment after a small diagonal.  The LCX had a 90% stenosis 
				of the OM1 proximally and a 50% followed by a 70% stenosis in 
				the proximal and mid segment of the OM2. The RCA had a 90% 
				stenosis in the mid PDA. 
				2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly to moderately 
				elevated left sided filling pressures (LVEDP was 18 mm Hg).  
				Systemic arterial pressure was normal (aortic pressure was 
				121/73 mm Hg).  There was no significant gradient across the 
				aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter from the left 
				ventricle to the ascending aorta. 
				3.  Left ventriculography revealed a contrast calculated 
				ejection 
				fraction of 65%.  No mitral regurgitation was noted. 4.  
				Bilateral selective renal angiography demonstrated widely patent 
				renal arteries. 
				FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
				1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 
				2. Normal left ventricular systolic function. 
				3. Mildly to moderately elevated left sided filling pressures. 
				4. No angiographically apparent renal artery stenosis.

				Conclusions:  
				PRE-CPB: 
				1.The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.  
				2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
				normal cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular  systolic dysfunction with apical anterior hypokinesis.. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is  mildly depressed. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function.  
				3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  
				4. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated at a maximum of 3.7. There are simple  atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending  thoracic aorta.  
				5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.  
				6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal  
				limits).  
				7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. POST-CPB: Patient is on phenylephrine infusion. Preserved biventricular  systolic function with improvement of the anteroapical hypokinetic segment. LVEF now 55%. Trace MR. [**Last Name (Titles) 1654**] is normal post decannulation.

				   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

				CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**3195-4-3**] 11:20 AM

				CHEST (PA & LAT)

				Reason: r/o ptx 

				UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
				69 yoM s/p CABG and CT removal 
				REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
				r/o ptx 
				TWO VIEW CHEST OF [**3195-4-3**].

				COMPARISON: [**3195-3-31**]

				INDICATION: Chest tube removal.

				Various lines and tubes have been removed since the prior radiograph, and a very small left apical pneumothorax has developed. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits for postoperative status of the patient. Small pleural effusions and minor bibasilar atelectasis are noted. These findings are superimposed upon subtle likely more chronic peripheral and basilar interstitial lung disease.

				On the lateral view, small air-fluid level is present in the retrosternal region likely representing an anterior hydropneumothorax, and additional air is present in the retrosternal region, an expected postoperative finding given the time interval since surgery.

				IMPRESSION: Small left pneumothorax following tube removal. 
				Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.

		6. Self-limited, brief myotoclonus event.
		COMMENTS: 
		1. Limited coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant 
		system
		with left main and severe native vessel disease. The LMCA had an 
		ostial
		60% lesion. The proximal and midvessel LAD had diffuse calcific 
		disease.
		The distal LAD filled via a LIMA which was not selectively 
		engaged. The
		D1 branch was totally occluded. The LCx had mild diffuse 
		disease. The
		RCA and bypass grafts were not successfully engaged.
		2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a central blood 
		pressure of
		132/57 mmHg and a left CFA pressure of 101/67 mmHg. The mean 
		gradient
		was 3 mmHg.
		3. Retrograde access of the left common femoral artery was 
		obtained for
		selective carotid, vertebral, and coronary angiography. The 
		thoracic
		aorta had a Type I arch. The bilateral subclavian arteries had 
		mild
		proximal disease. The left subclavian artery had a 50% lesion in 
		the
		origin with a peak to peak gradient of 20 mmHg.
		4. The right vertebral artery was small and diminutive with a 
		total
		occlusion at the base of the skull before entering the brain. 
		The left
		vertebral artery was large and was noted to have a 60% origin 
		lesion and
		filled the basilar and the cerebellar arteries. The 
		contralateral PCA
		filled from the vertebral but the ipsilateral (left) PCA was not 
		seen.
		5. The right common carotid artery was without disease but the 
		ICA was
		totally occluded. The left common carotid artery was without 
		disease but
		the ICA had diffuse tubular 80% disease. The left ICA filled the
		ipsilateral ACA and MCA as well as the contralateral ACA and MCA 
		via a
		large ACOM.
		6. Successful placement of a [**4-26**] x 40 mm Acculink stent in the 
		left ICA
		postdilated with a 4.5 mm balloon. Final angiography 
		demonstrated no
		residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and 
		normal
		flow (See PTCA Comments).
		7. Transient, self-limited myoclonic event during postdilation 
		which was
		though not likely to represent seizure activity.
		8. Successful Perclose of the left femoral arteriotomy site at 
		the
		conclusion of the procedure without complications.

		Cath at OSH [**8-22**]: ""multiple tight stenoses of the proximal LAD 
		and proximal D1. Proximal D2 occluded. RCA proximally occluded. 
		LIMA to LAD patent, svg to diag could not be visualized and was 
		presumed occluded. Left carotid patent, right carotid occluded."" 


		cardiac cath [**2012-1-23**]
		1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
		2. Rotation atheterectomy of the proximal LAD.
		3. Unsuccessful attempt at PTCA/stenting of the D1.
		COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right
		dominant system. The RCA was not injected. The SVgs and the LIMA 
		were
		not injected. The LMCA had a 60% ostial stenosis. The proximal 
		LAD [**Last Name (un) **]
		80% calcific stenosis. The distal LAD was filling via a LIMA 
		(there was
		competitive flow). The D1 had a 80% calcific stenosis at the 
		origin. The
		LCX had mild diffuise disease.
		2. Unsuccessful attempt at PTCA/stenting of the D1 due to 
		inability to
		cross despite using multiple wires. Rotational atherectomy was 
		performed
		in the LAD in an attempt to modify the LAD lesion and allow 
		crossing
		inro the D1 (See PTCA comments).

		carotid series [**2012-1-23**]:
		REASON: Known carotid atherosclerosis, pre-op for stenting. 
		 
		FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid 
		arteries. 
		Significant plaque was identified on the right. There is no flow 
		in internal 
		carotid artery including power Doppler technique. Of note there 
		is no study 
		for comparison. 
		 
		On the left, significant mostly soft appearing homogeneous 
		plaque is 
		identified in the internal carotid artery. Of note it appears to 
		extend 
		fairly distally in the cervical internal carotid artery. 
		 
		On the right, peak systolic velocities are 52, 72 in the CCA, 
		ECA 
		respectively. 
		 
		On the left, in the internal carotid artery the peak systolic 
		over diastolic 
		velocity is 361/123. In the remainder of the vessel the peak 
		systolic 
		velocities are 54, 584 in the CCA, ECA respectively. The ICA-CCA 
		ratio is 6. 
		This is consistent with an 80-99% stenosis.

	     REASON:  Narrowing of carotid artery.
	     
	     STUDY #2, ARTERIAL DOPPLER CLAUDICATION.
	     
	     FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries.  The
	     right internal carotid artery is occluded.  On the left, a carotid stent is
	     visualized and is patent but has significant elevated velocities as will be
	     described below.
	     
	     On the right, peak systolic velocities are 45, 115 in the CCA and ECA
	     respectively.
	     
	     On the left in the internal carotid artery, the peak systolic over diastolic
	     velocity is 319/124.  In the remainder of the vessel, the peak systolic
	     velocities are 56, 123 in the CCA, ECA respectively.  The ICA to CCA ratio is
	     5.6.  This is consistent with an 80% to 99% stenosis.
	     
	     There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
	     
	     Although velocities in the left internal carotid artery stent are consistent
	     with a high-grade stenosis, this is likely falsely elevated to both to the
	     stent and also to the contralateral occlusion.
	     
	     IMPRESSION:  Occluded right internal carotid artery.  On the left, the stent
	     is patent, but the velocities are elevated, consistent with an 80% to 99%
	     stenosis.  However, as stated above, that is likely to be artifactually
	     elevated.
	     
	     Doppler evaluation was performed of both lower extremity arterial systems at
	     rest and with exercise.  Exercise consist of toe-ups for 1 minute and 45
	     seconds.  Pain developed in both calves at 1 minute.
	     
	     On the right, Doppler tracings are triphasic at all levels from the femoral to
	     the dorsalis pedis artery.  The ankle brachial index is 1.06.  Pulse volume
	     recordings are maintained to the calf and show drop off at the ankle and
	     metatarsals.  After exercise, the ABI dropped to 0.47 and the waveforms in the
	     common femoral artery becomes monophasic.
	     
	     On the left, Doppler tracings are triphasic at the femoral level only.  They
	     are monophasic below.  The ankle brachial index is 0.69.  With exercise, this
	     decreases to 0.27.  Pulse volume recordings are dampened at low thigh level
	     and approximately 7 mm at the metatarsals.
	     
	     IMPRESSION:  Significant aortobiiliac and likely left superficial femoral
	     artery occlusive disease.  In addition, there may be proximal femoral artery
	     disease on the right.  With very limited exercise, there is a severe decrement
	     in bilateral ABI.'

	     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
	      64 year old man with carotid stent for surveillance
	     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
	      history carotid stent for surveillance
	     ______________________________________________________________________________
	                                     FINAL REPORT
	     INDICATION: Surveillance of carotid artery stent in a 64-year-old man.
	     
	     COMPARISON: There were two available comparisons, from [**1-23**] and [**7-25**], 2005, respectively. They showed a stable, 80-99% diameter narrowing of the
	     left internal carotid artery and a known, complete occlusion of the right
	     internal carotid artery.
	     
	     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Duplex ultrasonography was performed at the level of
	     the cervical portions of the bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries.
	     
	     The chronic occlusion of the right internal carotid artery is found again,
	     with no intraluminal flow detectable by spectral or color Doppler imaging. The
	     peak systolic velocities in the right common and external carotid arteries are
	     57 and 109 cm/second, respectively.
	     
	     The left carotid stent is visualized at the level of the internal and common
	     carotid arteries. The peak systolic velocities in the left internal, common,
	     and external carotid arteries are 291, 53, and 446 cm/second. The end-
	     diastolic velocities are 100 cm/second in the left internal carotid artery and
	     25 cm/sec in the left common carotid artery. The acceleration in the
	     internal carotid artery seems localized to its mid and distal cervical
	     portions but spares its ostium. Systolic turbulences are found in the distal
	     portion of the left internal carotid artery. These values and findings are
	     again consistent with a luminal narrowing between 80 and 99% in diameter
	     (probably closer to 80%.).
	     
	     Antegrade flow is found in the bilateral vertebral arteries, in their
	     intertransverse portions.
	     
	     CONCLUSION: No significant change as compared to the two prior available
	     comparison from March and [**2012-7-20**], with:
	     1. a known occlusion of the right internal carotid artery, and
	     2. status post stent placement in the region of the left carotid bulb, and
	     increased velocities in the mid and distal portion of the left internal
	     carotid artery consistent with a stenosis estimated between 80 and 99% in
	     diameter (closer to 80%).'
